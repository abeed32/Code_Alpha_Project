Overview of the Project
Project: Predicting Unemployment and Car Prices

Objective: To analyze and predict trends in unemployment rates and car prices using real-world datasets by applying exploratory data analysis (EDA), regression models, and machine learning techniques.

Key Activities:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and ensuring data consistency.
Data Visualization: Exploring trends and distributions through visualizations such as line plots, histograms, and heatmaps.
Model Building: Using machine learning models like Random Forest Classifier and Linear Regression for prediction tasks.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, accuracy, and classification reports.
Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features for predictive modeling and ensuring the features are appropriately scaled.
Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language for data analysis.
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib and seaborn: Data visualization.
scikit-learn: Machine learning models and metrics.
joblib: Model serialization.
Key Insights:
Unemployment Rate Prediction:

Trend Analysis: The unemployment rate is visualized over time, showing fluctuations across various periods.
Feature Correlation: Some features show strong correlations with unemployment, helping improve model prediction accuracy.
Model Performance: Linear regression is used to predict unemployment rate based on historical data, and the model's performance is evaluated through MSE.
Car Price Prediction:

Feature Engineering: Categorical features such as car name, fuel type, and transmission type are encoded to numerical values for predictive modeling.
Model: Random Forest Regressor is used to predict car prices based on multiple features, including fuel type, transmission, and car specifications.
Model Evaluation: MSE and R-squared are used to evaluate the model's ability to predict car prices accurately.
Technologies and Techniques:
Random Forest Classifier: Used to classify iris species and predict car prices based on multiple features.
Linear Regression: Applied to predict continuous variables like unemployment rate.
Random Forest Regressor: Predicts car prices based on various input features.
Label Encoding: Converts categorical data into numerical values for model input.
Project Workflow:
Data Acquisition: Datasets are loaded, cleaned, and pre-processed.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations and summary statistics are generated to understand the data.
Model Building: Machine learning models are trained on the dataset to predict unemployment rates and car prices.
Evaluation: Models are evaluated using relevant metrics (accuracy, MSE, R-squared).
Prediction: Real-world predictions (e.g., unemployment rate, car prices) are made using trained models.
Future Work:
Improve model accuracy by exploring more advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning.
Incorporate more features or external datasets to enhance prediction capabilities.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning, to solve real-world problems such as unemployment prediction and car price estimation. The ability to handle and preprocess data effectively and build accurate predictive models showcases strong competence in data science practices.
